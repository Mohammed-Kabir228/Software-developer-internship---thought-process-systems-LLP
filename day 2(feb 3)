1. Library System Implementation (Single Inheritance)
In this code, we use super().__init__() to ensure the parent class handles the title and author while the child class handles the issued details.

  # Parent Class
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

    def display_book_details(self):
        print(f"Book: {self.title}")
        print(f"Author: {self.author}")

# Child Class inheriting from Book
class IssuedBook(Book):
    def __init__(self, title, author, issued_to, issued_date):
        # Initializing parent class attributes using super()
        super().__init__(title, author)
        self.issued_to = issued_to
        self.issued_date = issued_date

    def display_issued_book_details(self):
        # Calls the parent method first
        self.display_book_details()
        # Then adds the specific details for the issued book
        print(f"Issued To: {self.issued_to}")
        print(f"Due Date: {self.issued_date}")

# --- Object Instantiation ---
# Updated names: "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, issued to "Sarah Connor"
member_record = IssuedBook("Clean Code", "Robert C. Martin", "Sarah Connor", "2026-03-15")

print("--- Library Checkout Receipt ---")
member_record.display_issued_book_details()

3. Multiple Inheritance Example
Since your task asked for an implementation of this as well, here is a common real-world scenario:

class Microphone:
    def record_audio(self):
        print("Recording crystal clear audio...")

class Monitor:
    def show_display(self):
        print("Rendering 4K resolution visuals...")

# Child class inheriting from both Microphone and Monitor
class PodcastStation(Microphone, Monitor):
    def start_streaming(self):
        print("Station is now LIVE on the server.")

# Testing Multiple Inheritance with new object name
my_studio = PodcastStation()
my_studio.record_audio()  # From Microphone
my_studio.show_display()  # From Monitor
my_studio.start_streaming()


Type,Description,Example
Single,1 Parent → 1 Child,Book → IssuedBook
Multilevel,Parent → Child → Grandchild,Device → Phone → iPhone
Hierarchical,1 Parent → Multiple Children,Book → IssuedBook & DigitalBook
Multiple,Multiple Parents → 1 Child,Microphone & Monitor → PodcastStation
Hybrid,A mix of the above,A complex system combining Multiple and Hierarchical
